# Democratic_DJ

Sick of those militant DJs who won't listen to their audience!? Try Democratic DJ. Join or host a room, then play music through Spotify. Listeners who join rooms can vote to skip or pause songs.

- A web app created using Django and NodeJs
- The app allows users to create 'rooms' and play music over Spotify. Others can join this room and vote to skip songs or simply listen along.
- This app was created with inspiration from a tutorial on YouTube by Techwithtim
